How to Make Egg Noodles

Ingredients
2 to 2-1/2 cups all-purpose flour, divided
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 large eggs, lightly beaten
1 tablespoon cold water

Instructions
Step 1: Mix
In a large bowl or clean surface, combine 2 cups of flour and salt. Make a deep well in a center of the flour and then add the eggs and water to the well. Using your hands or a 
wooden spoon, mix the ingredients together until a soft dough forms.

Step 2: Knead
Gather the dough and transfer it to a floured surface. Shape into a ball and then knead until smooth, about 10 minutes. If the dough starts to get tacky as you work, dust it with 
the reserved flour to keep it from sticking, as needed.

Step 3: Roll thin
Next, divide the dough into thirds. Then, on a lightly floured surface, roll each portion of dough into a paper-thin rectangle using a rolling pin. Dust top of the dough with 
flour to prevent it from sticking to the rolling pin. When the dough reaches the desired thickness, trim the edges of the dough to create an even rectangle.

Step 4: Slice
Taking one of the short sides of the rectangle, begin to roll up the dough (like youâ€™re making cinnamon rolls). Then, using a sharp knife, cut 1/4-inch slices. Unroll noodles and 
allow them to dry flat on paper towels before cooking. Alternatively, you may also use a pizza cutter to cut long, even strips.

Step 5: Cook
To cook, bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a rapid boil. Drop noodles into the water and cook until al dente, about 7-10 minutes. Drain and then serve as part of your 
favorite noodle recipe.
